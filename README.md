# fuzz_harnesses
A repository with certain fuzz harnesses created for a master thesis.

You will find some harnesses and some reproducer in the corresponding folders.
It is important to mention, that you have to clone the source repository and include the path to the source into the harness file. By this, the source will be imported as a module.
Maybe you have to add a init.py file to the corresponding structure.
